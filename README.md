I'm working on an affiliate site for multiple amateure cam sites includeing [Chaturbate](https://chaturbate.com "Chaturbate: The Act of Masturbating While Chatting Online"). This happens to be similar to an idea I had for a feature. Same concept. multiple cams in one window. but I have a whole knew experience in store :) in the mean time, I'm going to doctor this a bit because I like it but it has some issues.

Oh wow, didn't realize I made this available yet. I was going to make this a little neater and give credit before I committed it but that's ok. I haven't done much to it yet but I'll update it when I'm done squashing the roaches.

# Issues
This is just the stuff I don't like and why. If there is something you don't like, get your own README.md and complain about it! __Totally Kidding!__ I've enabled the issues tab for that. This project has been dormant for __2 years__ so instead of creating an issue on the original I'm just starting my own where the creator left of. Please understand that I do not intend on taking credit for their work but only add to it in the spirit of open source software.

# Limitations

#### Don't lose your selection
Starting out I've run into some limitations that you may like to be aware of ahead of time. You will lose everything in your selection by advancing the pagination (numbered pages at the bottom) or switching to anything other than the current tab and VidGrid tab. You can toggle between them. You can work around this by going to the VidGrid tab and clicking on the, `Save` button prior to changing the page. Manually refreshing the page has the same affect however the automatic refresh does not (it does reset the text indicating your selection but it is still there).

#### Wtf?! WTB Context Menu!
Ya, originally the context menu was hijacked by an external @required JavaScript file. Never improve the U/X in one area only to destroy it in another.

#### It Doesn't Always Work
It happens. Eat something, hydrate, and sober up a bit. You'll be goo... Oh! Right! The uh... we're still talking about the script. Yeah the script doesn't like query strings. Or really any change to the url at the moment. It just needs @includes/@match additions. Coming soon! (If the, you know, _other problem_ continues they have pills for it)
